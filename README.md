# Hi, I'm Abdelmalek Samim 👋

Full-stack web developer focused on building accessible, performant, and maintainable web applications using modern JavaScript technologies. I have a strong background in React, TypeScript, and Node.js, and a passion for turning ideas into production-ready products.

## About me

I build clean, user-centered web experiences. I enjoy working across the stack — from crafting reusable UI components in React to designing RESTful APIs with Node.js. I value readable code, thoughtful architecture, and strong developer ergonomics.
